# TinkerToy

FastAPI based mini application for persistently managing small items.

The main concern for this minimal application is deployment examples.

The application supposed to have a UI and some business logic with persistent data store (SQLite). Future improvements might include some third party API calls, to enrich data.

Security is not yet implemented.
